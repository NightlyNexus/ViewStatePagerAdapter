ViewStatePagerAdapter
=====================

Saves and restores View states in ViewPagers.

[`ViewStatePagerAdapter`](viewstatepageradapter/src/main/java/com/nightlynexus/viewstatepageradapter/ViewStatePagerAdapter.java) is simply an implementation of `androidx.viewpager.widget.PagerAdapter` and automatically saves and restores View states when returning to pages (previously removed Views in the ViewPager) and after ViewPager's state restoration.
`ViewStatePagerAdapter` is similar to [`androidx.fragment.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentStatePagerAdapter/) but for use with just Views, rather than Fragments.

### Sample

The sample application shows the difference between the use of a `ViewStatePagerAdapter` and a `ViewPagerAdapter` (with no saving and restoring of View state).
